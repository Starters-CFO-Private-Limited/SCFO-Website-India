      return "In simple terms, startup valuation is the process of quantifying the worth of a company, aka its valuation. During the seed funding round, an investor pours in funds in a startup in exchange for a part of the equity in the company. This is why valuation is important for entrepreneurs as it helps in determining the equity which they have to give to a seed investor in exchange of funds."

      return "Valuation matters to every startup because it helps in deciding the amount of equity an entrepreneur has to give to an investor in exchange for requisite funds. This implies that if a company has a higher valuation, it has to give a lesser amount of equity or shares to an investor in exchange for seed investment. Not only for entrepreneurs, but startup valuation is also vital from investors’ point of view because it helps them gauge the amount of return they will receive on their invested amount."

      return "If you have prepared the right business plan, a catchy pith deck, and your financial forecasts, then your startup will have more of a fixed value than an idea. However, debating the value in this case is very difficult because you don’t have a product nor do you have any income generated. At this stage the valuation will depend on the attractiveness of the idea, how good the business plan, monetization strategy is written, background of founders and their ability to execute the plan they have put, and the speculated risks."
